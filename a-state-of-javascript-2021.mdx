We saw a lot of great improvements to the JavaScript language in 2020 with the release
of [ES2020 in June](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/releases/tag/es2020) last year. I won't cover
all of the changes, but I will briefly mention a few of my favorite features that I use on
an (almost) daily basis. I'll also talk about some of the changes that will be coming in
[ES2021 in June](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/releases/tag/es2021-candidate-2021-03) later this year.

## Features in ES2020

### 1. Nullish coalescing
This one should be familiar to all of you out there using TypeScript 3.7+. I've certainly been using
it for some time now and it's great to see it officially integrated in ES2020. Essentially, the new `??`
operator enables a fallback to a specific value when an `undefined` or `null` is encountered. Here's an example:
```js
/** Fallback if "potentiallyNullString" is null or undefined */
const someValue = potentiallyNullString ?? 'A default string';

/** Functionally equivalent to */
const someValue = potentiallyNullString !== null && potentiallyNullString !== undefined
  ? potentiallyNullString
  : 'A default string';
```
Not only does the _nullish coalescing_ operator make the code block more concise, it also provides some
solid protection for previous use cases of the `||` operator. Here's another example:
```js
const someValue = emptyString || 'A default string';
```
It's possible that in the above code block, the `someValue` variable _should_ default to an empty string.
However in this case, it won't, it will default to `A default string` due to the logical _or_ operator
and the fact that the empty string is falsy. The nullish coalescing operator introduces safeguards and
provides great handling for edge cases when encountering falsy values such as `0`, `NaN` or `''`.

### 2. Optional chaining
This one goes hand in hand with the nullish coalsecing operator. Also introduced in TypeScript 3.7,
optional chaining allows code to stop executing if a `null` or `undefined` is encountered. Optional chaining
is even more useful when combined with the nullish coalsecing operator to set defaults. Here's an example:
```js

/** Optionally call a function or return an empty array  */
const result = state.value?.action() ?? [];
```
Optional chaining also simplifies code that checks for properties on objects:
```js

/** Before */
if (state && state.value && state.value.x) { ... }

/** After */
if (state?.value?.x) { ... }
```

### 3. Promise.allSettled
Similar to `Promise.all` or `Promise.race`, this enhancement runs all promises regardless of the results.
This is especially useful when performing several network requests in parallel, where _some_ of the requests
might either fail or return an error, and others might succeed.
`Promise.allSettled` shines when each request is not dependent on another to complete successfully.
```js

/** Perform the network requests */
const requests = await Promise.allSettled([
  fetch(...),
  fetch(...),
  fetch(...)
]);

/** Split the requests into successes and failures */
const [errors, results] = requests.reduce((accum, request) => {
  if (request.status === 'rejected') accum[0].push(request);
  else if (request.status === 'fulfilled') accum[1].push(request);
  return accum;
}, [[], []]);
```

## Features in ES2021

### 1. Logical assignment operators
Three new operators are proposed for the release in mid of this year. The `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=`
operators all allow conditional variable assignment. Here are a few examples:
```js
/** Assign y to x if x is falsy */
const x ||= y;

/** Assign y to x if x is truthy */
const x &&= y;

/** Assign y to x if x is null/undefined */
const x ??= y;
```
I don't immediately see myself using these operators, but I will keep them in mind. Personally,
I think the last one, the `??=` would be the most useful.

### 2. String.replaceAll
Yes! I feel like I have been constantly reimplementing this across different projects, so it is great
to see it added as a core functionality. As you might have guessed, `replaceAll` replaces all
occurances of a string/pattern with the second parameter passed into it. Consider it a sequal to the
built in `replace` function for strings.
```js
const str = 'Bob is a builder. Bob builds the best fences.';

const first = str.replace('Bob', 'Tom'); // Tom is a builder. Bob builds the best fences.
const second = str.replaceAll('Bob', 'Tom'); // Tom is a builder. Tom builds the best fences.
```

### 3. Promise.any
Similar to `Promise.allSettled` but with a twist. The new `.any()` method on `Promise` takes an array of
promises and resolves with the first (read: fastest) successful promise. Otherwise, it rejects if all promises reject.
On the surface, this doesn't seem all that useful, however one interesting use case could be loading external
resources from the _fastest_ server. Consider a browser client application with the following:
```js
const resource = await Promise.any([
  fetch('https://us.example.com/resource-a').then(response => response.json()),
  fetch('https://uk.example.com/resource-a').then(response => response.json()),
  fetch('https://jp.example.com/resource-a').then(response => response.json())
]);
```
Notice how in the example above, we are requesting a resource from a region specific endpoint. Using `Promise.any`
enables this kind of functionality, where the application interacts with the _fastest_ server relative to
the geographical location of the client.

### 4. Numeric separator and Weakref
Lastly, there are two other new features introduced. The first, the Numeric separator is a readability improvement
for displaying large numbers, i.e. 123456789 can become 123_456_789 while still behaving as a number.

The second feature, [Weakref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef)
is more complex and probably deserving of its own article. The [TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs#a-note-of-caution)
even mentions that it should be avoided if possible so I won't be covering it here.

That is mostly it! I'll be looking forward to next year and seeing what will make it into ES2022.
