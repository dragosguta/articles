It took me a while to understand the point of using something like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
The additional work to set up, manage, and use it for a given project seemed unnecessary, and I simply did not understand how
it could live up to its tagline of "[streamlining] UI development". It finally clicked for me once I started working within a larger
organization, development team, and with various stakeholders. These days, I almost always set up Storybook in any new UI project as the
value that it provides certainly outweighs the time spent to set it up.

## Component driven development

I'm sure by now a lot has been said on the awesome benefits of component driven development (CDD). I've certainly become a believer and subscribe to the methodology.
To summarize, the goal of CDD is to produce reusable components. These components are very similar in theory to LEGO pieces, a perfect
analogy that has been constantly used to describe them. LEGO pieces form an end product that can be broken down and recycled over and over,
to produce something new. Good components attempt to match this exact behavior, to be assembled and reassembled across countless user interfaces (UIs).

As a side note, I don't believe that CDD should be solely reserved for front-end development, although that is mainly where it has gained its popularity. The goal
is always to create reusable pieces of code and as such, I am sure that a lot of the concepts can be applied across the full stack.

Still, I'll be mostly focusing and discussing CDD in terms of front-end development since the focus is both on CDD and Storybook. There
are some great resources to slowly ease into the mindset, including Storybook's own [tutorial series](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/).

## Isolation and interfaces

I was working on a React application years ago that had a resource creation "wizard" or flow. Essentially, the user is asked to complete
a series of steps to define a business resource that is then managed through the UI. This was all standard behavior and a pretty generic pattern
for creation, nothing new or out of the ordinary on the screen. The problem was with the code. I found myself staring at an extensive file with deeply nested [DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
(they were really JSX elements to be specific). A change in this file meant that the development UI would re-render, and that I would have to go to the beginning of the creation process.
Now, this isn't exactly a big deal... but it is incredibly annoying to wait ~5 seconds or so for every change. What made things worse is that I needed to modify something on the last step,
so every change meant that I would have to cycle through the creation process until I reached the last step.

I suffered through it at the time, without realizing that this would have been a perfect use case for a tool like Storybook. If I had
been able to work with that specific piece of code in isolation, I would have been able to focus more on the business logic, eliminate the progress
step cycling, and save some time and frustration. Granted, that particular UI was not really following a CDD process, so I would still
need to untangle the current implementation, and then create some sort of reusable component(s) out of it.

Even so, the ability to model a piece of logic like this is crucial to adopting a component driven mindset. Working in isolation results in
a fundamental shift in thinking about how to best implement a specific component and ultimately a feature. The way that I approached development
changed once I started working with Storybook and CDD. I started to think about the code that I was writing from a functional programmming perspective.
From this perspective each component, and block of logic is broken down into three fundamental concepts:

```
1. inputs (in the form of props)
2. actions on inputs (aka business logic)
3. outputs (via onChange function calls)
```

The first concept refers to the inputs that are coming into the component. In React, these would be the properties passed in. This is also what creates
the interface for the component. The next concept refers to the actions (or business logic) performed _inside_ of the component. I would include any hooks in here as well, and technically
side effects. This is also entirely optional, it's possible that a component
is used solely for presentational purposes. Otherwise, all logic responsible for making this component "work" should be encapsulated inside of it.

Lastly, the component may or may not have outputs. If it does have outputs, it should respond via an `onChange` function call, essentially emitting
its current state to the parent. This should be the only method of communication between a child component and a parent component in order to keep
a clean interface.

Working on components in this manner, developing them in Storybook and then using them in the main UI becomes trivial. It might seem like what I'm really
preaching is more about well designed interfaces, but make no mistake, working inside of Storybook, in isolation like this, forces the developer to think in a way that
naturally results in components with encapsulation and clean, simple interfaces. When all other distractions and elements are removed, all that remains are the inputs
that a component needs to behave in a certain way, and the optional outputs that it might emit. Storybook ultimately encourages this method of thinking through the use of Stories.

## Demonstrating progress

There have been countless times when I've had to get some quick feedback
on components that I've built. Normally, I can just bring up a development build of the UI... but what if I have to make some _quick_
changes? What if I have to change a color, or adjust some spacing, to get everything _juuuuust_ right. Do I wait for the build to run, after all
every second counts in a meeting as fatigue slowly creeps in the longer it goes.

Usually it's simpler to just showcase the component right in Storybook. The isolation aspect removes any distractions, and re-renders, and focuses the conversation
on the design of the component at hand. This is especially useful when working directly with a design team. Storybook enables developers to take a design prototype,
implement a "first draft" version of the components in the prototype, and turn around to get some feedback. This iterative loop encourages a developer and a designer to pair up and work together
to achieve an implementation that closely matches a design prototype. The designer is free to focus on the presentational aspect
while the developer demonstrates how the component behaves and responds to different inputs -- all within Storybook. The developer drives and owns
this process. Components are then transferred to the main UI once both the developer and designer are satisfied with the implementation.

## Closing thoughts

I've been a big fan of Storybook for some time now. I will continue to use it in all of my future projects
mainly due to the fact that it enables a component driven development process. A process where the developer
is pushed in the positive direction of clean interfaces, encapsulation, and where gathering feedback is made simple
and encouraged due to the isolationist nature of the environment.
